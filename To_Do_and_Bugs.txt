To-do List:

1) Find an algorithm to find optimal contrast settings
	- currently we have a good ballpark for each xray
	- can find a threshold using some kind of 

2) Find an algorithm to find the optimal croppings
	- currently just do manual croppings

3) Process the border/edges after contrast and find location of femoral head/sacral plate
	- cross correlation and find xOffSet, yOffSet with peak of normxcross2, should find ballpark of places

4) Calculate necessary parameters
	- after finish number 3
